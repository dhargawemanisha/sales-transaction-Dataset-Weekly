# 1. Apply K-Means Clustering:

K-means clustering is a technique to group similar data points into clusters. Each data point is assigned to the cluster whose centroid (mean) is closest to it. Here's how the process works:

You have your dataset with multiple data points, each having multiple features.
Choose a range of possible values for K, the number of clusters you want to form.
Initialize K cluster centroids. These centroids represent the center of each cluster.
Iterate through the following steps until convergence:
Assign each data point to the nearest centroid based on a distance metric (usually Euclidean distance).
Recalculate the centroids of each cluster as the mean of the data points assigned to it.
# 2. Determine K using the Elbow Method:

The elbow method helps you find the optimal number of clusters by looking at how the within-cluster sum of squared distances changes as K increases. Follow these steps:

For each K (number of clusters), run the k-means algorithm and compute the sum of squared distances (inertia) between data points and their assigned centroids.
Plot the inertia values against the corresponding K values.
Look for the "elbow point" on the plot where the inertia starts to decrease less sharply. This point indicates a good balance between model complexity and fitting the data.
3. Plot Data in 2D and 3D using PCA after Clustering:

After determining the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method, you can visualize the clustered data in lower dimensions using PCA:

Apply k-means again with the chosen optimal K on your dataset.
Get the cluster assignments for each data point.
Perform PCA to reduce the dimensionality of your data to 2 or 3 dimensions.
Create scatter plots for 2D and 3D visualizations. Each data point should be colored based on its cluster assignment.
# Result:
This code should provide a more comprehensive understanding of how to implement the k-means clustering, elbow method, and PCA visualization steps. Remember to adapt it to your specific dataset and requirements.
